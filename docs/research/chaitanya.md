# Research: Chaitanya Sai (Kasani)

## General Overview
**URL**: [https://chaitanya-product.com/](https://chaitanya-product.com/)
**Role**: Product Expert / PM / Product Designer
**Vibe**: No-nonsense, metric-driven, highly professional, text-forward.

## Tech Stack & Architecture (Inferred)
- **Core Technology**: Static HTML/CSS or a lightweight SSG (Static Site Generator). 
- **Structure**: Extremely simple multi-page structure (`index.html`, `pitch.html`, `resume.html`).
- **Focus**: The tech stack is intentionally invisible. The focus is 100% on the content and the data.

## Notable Features & Strengths
1. **The "Pitch"**: Instead of just saying "Hi, I'm a designer", the hero section directly addresses business value: *"I turn business chaos into platform clarity."*
2. **Quantifiable Outcomes**: Every single project listing includes hard metrics (e.g., "scaled to 1M+ requests", "cut resolution time by 35%", "drove 40% K-12 revenue lift").
3. **Scannability**: The use of bold headers, tight bullet points, and direct links allows a hiring manager to understand his value in under 15 seconds.

## Takeaways for Our Project
- **Metrics Over Eye Candy**: While we want our site to look like Himanshu's (Framer-style animations) and have interactive elements like 109ichiki, the actual *content text* must be written like Chaitanya's.
- **The "Pitch"**: We need a strong value proposition in our Hero section, not just "Full-Stack Developer."
- **Data Structure Validation**: Our `portfolio_extra.json` and `portfolio_data.json` must be updated to ensure they hold outcome-based data, not just lists of technologies used.
