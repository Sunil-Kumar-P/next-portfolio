# Research: Himanshu Bhardwaj

## General Overview
**Featured On**: [Wall of Portfolios](https://www.wallofportfolios.in/portfolios/himanshu-bhardwaj/)
**Role**: Product Designer @ PhysicsWallah
**Vibe**: User-centric, growth-oriented, clean UI/UX showcase.

## Tech Stack & Architecture (Inferred via Search)
- **Core Technology**: **Framer** (Website builder/React framework). Search engine indexing reveals links associated with `framer.ai` and `framer.website`.
- **Why Framer?**: Product designers heavily favor Framer because it allows for high-fidelity prototyping, complex scroll animations, and spatial layout management without needing to write complex React code manually.

## Notable Features & Strengths
1. **Focus on Outcomes**: Highlighted work involves massive scale (15 million users) and specific business metrics (restructuring educational batches for revenue growth).
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Framer sites excel at typography and grid layouts, leading to very readable, magazine-like case studies.
3. **Smooth Micro-interactions**: Framer's built-in motion engine provides incredibly smooth scroll-jacking, parallax, and hover states out of the box.

## Takeaways for Our Project
- **Case Study Depth**: We need to ensure that the project section of our portfolio isn't just a list of links, but includes the "Why" and "Impact" (similar to how a Product Designer presents).
- **Framer Motion in React**: Since his site looks amazing due to Framer's animation engine, we MUST utilize `framer-motion` in our Next.js/Material UI build to replicate those high-end, buttery-smooth interactions.
